## Data

I utilized the comprehensive dataset from BBC (**bbc_news.csv**), comprising over 25,642 news articles, to develop a cutting-edge news recommendation application. From this extensive collection, I meticulously curated and stored a subset of 1,000 articles within a PostgreSQL database. This strategic approach ensures a robust foundation for the recommendation engine, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of the application.
